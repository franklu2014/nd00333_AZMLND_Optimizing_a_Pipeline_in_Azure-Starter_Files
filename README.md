# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary

This project analyzes and models a dataset containing customer information about bank marketing, and we aim to predicting the outcome of a marketing strerategy based on the customer's education, marital status, etc.

The best performing model was a VotingEnsemble classifier that has a accuacy of 0.917 and a weighted ROC AUC of 0.95.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

The categorical features in the dataset are transformed with One-Hot encoding, and the dataset is split into train set and test set.  We then fit a LogisticRegression model with the train set and use HyperDrive to tune the `C` hyperparameter for regularization strength.

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

In the configuration of HyperDrive, we use BayesianParameterSampling to choose the `C` papameter from a Uniform distribution between [0.01, 10].  The reason of using BayesianParameterSampling is that it uses Bayesian optimization to intelligently pick the next sample of hyperparameters based on the performance of the previous samples.

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

Due to the current limitation of Azure HyperDrive, BayesianParameterSampling couldn't be used with a policy.

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

The best model generated by AutoML is a VotingEnsemble 

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
